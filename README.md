# Music2Note

This repository holds a MATLAB implementation of extracting musical notes from recorded tracks as well as real-time tuner-like functions. The main functionality is implemented in `get_notes.m`.

Two demoes for offline and online use are available.
- Run `offline_demo.m` with your music track of choice, set the parameters and check the extracted notes.
- Run `online_demo.m`, make sure correct input device is set (`device_number`), and watch the frequency magnitude plot and the extracted note with the highest amplitude.
